By figuring out that the starting node were all mod 271 to get to the
ending node (by modifying 8-a.pl), and the ending nodes all cycled back to
themselves with the same distance, I realized quickly it was a LCM (least
common multiple) problem and just computed the least common multiple using
other scripts I already had from Project Euler.

So no code here.
